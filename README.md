# SWG-SHADE Bot 1.0!

A Discord bot made for crafters in Star Wars Galaxies!
This bot will enable the following commands in your Discord server (press TAB to navigate through parameters when using commands):

## /register_vendor {name} {location} {(optional) discounts}
This command registers your vendor as a drop-off location, and adds it to the /discounts command (only if you supply a discount)

## /discounts
This command lists all vendors in the guild with discounts!

## /unregister_vendor {name}
This command unregisters a vendor with the provided name (only works if the vendor is under your Discord ID)

## /contract {name} {quantity} {cpu}
This command opens a contract which can be accepted, cancelled, unaccepted, complete, uncomplete, and confirmed. ONLY the Crafter and the Miner may interact with the contract. Select "Vendors" while "IN PROGRESS" to see a list of drop-off locations!

CANCELLED <- OPEN <-> IN PROGRESS <-> COMPLETE -> CONFIRMED

## /my_contracts
See a list of your open contracts along with their current status and a link to the original post!
